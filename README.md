# 20Time-ICS4U

Week 1:
I have decided to learn Swift so I can create some sort of Application for the Iphone.
I started watching videos and tutorials and can hopefully have some sort code or 
screenshot of progress posted here by next week.

Week 2:
Im continuing to learn the swift language and I'm currently working on a small project 
that I will hopefully have completed and posted by next week but as of right now Im still
just watching tutorials and don't have any finished projects to post yet.

Week 3:
This week was tough as I ran into some issues but eventually fixed them all and now have a simple food 
tracking app that is almost done. I will hopefully have it done within the next week or two and then I can post it
and start working on a bigger project now that I have a much better understadning of the swift coding language.
