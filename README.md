# 20Time-ICS4U

Week 1:
I have decided to learn Swift so I can create some sort of Application for the Iphone.
I started watching videos and tutorials and can hopefully have some sort code or 
screenshot of progress posted here by next week.

Week 2:
Im continuing to learn the swift language and I'm currently working on a small project 
that I will hopefully have completed and posted by next week but as of right now Im still
just watching tutorials and don't have any finished projects to post yet.

Week 3:
This week was tough as I ran into some issues but eventually fixed them all and now have a simple food 
tracking app that is almost done. I will hopefully have it done within the next week or two and then I can post it
and start working on a bigger project now that I have a much better understadning of the swift coding language.

Week 4:
I have a functioning program thats almost done as I still want to add a few more features to it
I'm not sure exactly how to upload it as its an app so its a big collection of files, hopefully with 
some help next week I can figure this out and upload my progress. Other then this I should have this first app
done and all uploaded by next week. After that I'm hoping to start working on a bigger final project, which will
most likely be some sort of simple game or maybe an application.

Week 5:
I didn't have that much time this week to work on my project but in what little time I did have I've almost
my first project which I will post when its done hopefully within the next couple of days. Once I've finished that 
I will start working on a bigger final project which will be some sort of game for the Iphone.

Week 6:
I finished my first project the Food Tracker app and now I have a much better understanding of the swift language as 
while making this app I learned how to build a basic UI, connect the UI to code, work with view controllers, create a
cutom controller, create a table view, and how to implement navigation within the app. Now that I know all of this I 
wil start working on a new project in swift which is going to be a tetris game, It will use a lot of the skills I already
learned through the creation of my other app as well as some new ones. Depending on how long the tetris game takes I might 
make one more project but if not I will defintly have these two done.

Week 7; 
I have been working on my tetris game in swift and so far its going well as I've completed a good portion of it
and I think I'll have it done either by the end of next week or the start of the following week. So far I have 
created the main base for the game, as I've created the blocks and a clock for the timing on when they fall, as 
well as an array to store all of the blocks. For next week I will work on making the blocs fall in shapes, 
as well as actually being able to play the game which means I'm going to have to figure out how the user will
move the blocs when they fall.
