# 20Time-ICS4U

Week 1:
I have decided to learn Swift so I can create some sort of Application for the Iphone.
I started watching videos and tutorials and can hopefully have some sort code or 
screenshot of progress posted here by next week.

Week 2:
Im continuing to learn the swift language and I'm currently working on a small project 
that I will hopefully have completed and posted by next week but as of right now Im still
just watching tutorials and don't have any finished projects to post yet.

Week 3:
This week was tough as I ran into some issues but eventually fixed them all and now have a simple food 
tracking app that is almost done. I will hopefully have it done within the next week or two and then I can post it
and start working on a bigger project now that I have a much better understadning of the swift coding language.

Week 4:
I have a functioning program thats almost done as I still want to add a few more features to it
I'm not sure exactly how to upload it as its an app so its a big collection of files, hopefully with 
some help next week I can figure this out and upload my progress. Other then this I should have this first app
done and all uploaded by next week. After that I'm hoping to start working on a bigger final project, which will
most likely be some sort of simple game or maybe an application.

Week 5:
I didn't have that much time this week to work on my project but in what little time I did have I've almost
my first project which I will post when its done hopefully within the next couple of days. Once I've finished that 
I will start working on a bigger final project which will be some sort of game for the Iphone.

Week 6:
I finished my first project the Food Tracker app and now I have a much better understanding of the swift language as 
while making this app I learned how to build a basic UI, connect the UI to code, work with view controllers, create a
cutom controller, create a table view, and how to implement navigation within the app. Now that I know all of this I 
wil start working on a new project in swift which is going to be a tetris game, It will use a lot of the skills I already
learned through the creation of my other app as well as some new ones. Depending on how long the tetris game takes I might 
make one more project but if not I will defintly have these two done.

Week 7; 
I have been working on my tetris game in swift and so far its going well as I've completed a good portion of it
and I think I'll have it done either by the end of next week or the start of the following week. So far I have 
created the main base for the game, as I've created the blocks and a clock for the timing on when they fall, as 
well as an array to store all of the blocks. For next week I will work on making the blocs fall in shapes, 
as well as actually being able to play the game which means I'm going to have to figure out how the user will
move the blocs when they fall.

Week 8:
I didn't have a lot of time this week but during the time that I did have I was mostly trying to figure out git so I can upload my files for tetris this way as it will be much more efficent and I'll be able to see commit history. I've craeted a local repository to store my files I just to figure out how to upload it to my github repository. I'll hopefully have it ready within the next couple days and once I do I'll go back to finishing up my tetris project which I'll upload using git.

Week 9:
This week I mostly worked on using Git through the terminal on my computer which I now have fully functioning. I was able to create a local repository which I added all of my files too, then everytime I made changes locally I was able to commit them then push them up to GitHub. Now that I have Git working smoothly it will be much easier for my to commit all of my changes and I'll be able to see my entire commit history. For next week I'm going to work on finishing up my Tetris game which is coming along well. I've added a few things to the game since last time, I've made it so the blocs are randomly generated in random shapes which then fall down the screen. For the future I have to work on the blocs falling as there are a few bugs at the moment then all I have to do is add user interaction and I'm done the game.

Week 10:
I continued to work on my tetris throughout this week and I'm getting close to finishing it, I added and changed some code so the blocs fall in shapes with certain parameters. Next week I'm looking to add user interaction and once thats done then the games basically done. I've continued to use git making changes to my local repository and then pusing those changes directly to github with a couple simple commands. Throughout these past couple of weeks I've realized just how useful git is and how it makes it so much easier to push your changes to GitHub then having to go and sumbit every file indvidually.

Week 11/12:
The past couple of weeks I've just been working on finishing up my tetris game and I'm really close. It's almost all done I just have to add a couple of finishing touches and fix a couple problems. Other than that I should have the game done by this weekend and will write a better description of what I did next week.
