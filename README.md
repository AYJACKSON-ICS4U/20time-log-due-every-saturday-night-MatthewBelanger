# 20Time-ICS4U

Week 1:
I have decided to learn Swift so I can create some sort of Application for the Iphone.
I started watching videos and tutorials and can hopefully have some sort code or 
screenshot of progress posted here by next week.

Week 2:
Im continuing to learn the swift language and I'm currently working on a small project 
that I will hopefully have completed and posted by next week but as of right now Im still
just watching tutorials and don't have any finished projects to post yet.

Week 3:
This week was tough as I ran into some issues but eventually fixed them all and now have a simple food 
tracking app that is almost done. I will hopefully have it done within the next week or two and then I can post it
and start working on a bigger project now that I have a much better understadning of the swift coding language.

Week 4:
I have a functioning program thats almost done as I still want to add a few more features to it
I'm not sure exactly how to upload it as its an app so its a big collection of files, hopefully with 
some help next week I can figure this out and upload my progress. Other then this I should have this first app
done and all uploaded by next week. After that I'm hoping to start working on a bigger final project, which will
most likely be some sort of simple game or maybe an application.

Week 5:
I didn't have that much time this week to work on my project but in what little time I did have I've almost
my first project which I will post when its done hopefully within the next couple of days. Once I've finished that 
I will start working on a bigger final project which will be some sort of game for the Iphone.
