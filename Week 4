I have a functioning program thats almost done as I still want to add a few more features to it
I'm not sure exactly how to upload it as its an app so its a big collection of files, hopefully with 
some help next week I can figure this out and upload my progress. Other then this I should have this first app
done and all uploaded by next week. After that I'm hoping to start working on a bigger final project, which will
most likely be some sort of simple game or maybe an application.
